<div class="description">
    <p>The stage is set, the lights are dimmed, and a hush falls over the crowd.</p>

    <p>    
        Through an <i>extensive</i> screening process, our team has whittled down the
        entire <i>manga artform</i> to a handful of the most esteemed, highly-regarded
        examples. This process is highly secret, but we can tell you one thing: it
        certainly <i>wasn't</i> just picking them at random.
        
    <p>
        No, we most <i>definitely</i> didn't pick all these manga almost completely at random,
        with absolutely no idea what they are about other than their cover art and
        a three-word genre description.
    </p>

    <p>You'll have to trust us on that one.</p>

    <p>
        Now, the next phase begins. Over the next few weeks, we'll battle these
        hand-picked manga against each other to discover the answer to the ultimate
        question: what is the <i>best</i> manga?<span class="asterisk">*</span>
    </p>

    <p class="footnote">* Out of the ones we've randomly picked.</p>

<Heading>Round 1</Heading>


<div class="description">
    <ClashResult a={mangas[0]} b={mangas[1]} />

    <p>
        A decisive battle! Our very first Manga Clash started strong, pitting
        the Renaissance art-romance <i>Arte</i> against the absurd business-comedy <i>Trillion Game</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Arte</b>'s art was held in high esteem, but its failure to paint vivid enough portraits
        of its characters left some readers with the impression that it was merely... <em>"fine"</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, <b>Trillion Game</b> cashed in on its absurd comedic writing, and ultimately
        avoided paying the price for its relatively poor visual style, as it won gold in the
        first ever <b>Manga Clash</b> vote and proceeded through to the second stage.
    </p>
</div>

<Heading>Round 2</Heading>

<div class="description">
    <ClashResult a={mangas[2]} b={mangas[3]} />

    <p>
        Back once again, and this time with a distinctly farmyard-themed Manga Clash!
    </p>
    <p>
        That's right: this week we judged the lewd-ish horror comedy high school
        art psychological slice of life manga <i>Sheeply Horned Witch Romi</i>,
        whose name prompted mild confusion amongst our delegates, against the
        absurd-but-takes-itself-too-seriously <i>Rooster Fighter</i>, whose name
        couldn't be more on the nose. Or... beak?
    <p>
    <p>
        Though its visual appeal earned some praise, <b>Sheeply Horned Witch Romi</b>'s
        somewhat uncomfortable sex drive left a sour taste for some. 
        Thus, <b>Rooster Fighter</b> ended up taking out its opponent in a single
        "resonance blast", with its humour and commitment to the bit shining
        through.
    </p>
</div>

<Heading>Round 3</Heading>

<div class="description">
    <ClashResult a={mangas[4]} b={mangas[5]} />

    <p>
        Round 3 of Manga Clash saw the comfy broadcasting-club coming-of-age
        story <i>Hana wa Saku, Shura no Gotoku</i> face off against stylish
        sci-fi insurance drama <i>COSMOS</i>â€”both manga offering similarly niche
        plot concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        We found a lot to like in both of these titles. <b>Hana wa Saku, Shura
        no Gotoku</b> offered a cute premise, though its queer-baiting served as
        both a blessing and a curse. <b>COSMOS<b> was compared, not unfavourably,
        to the first Men in Black movie, and ultimately its plot proved gripping
        enough that we were itching to find out what happens next. And so, it
        claimed victory, and ensured a spot in the next round!
